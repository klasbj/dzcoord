dzcoord - the dzen2 coordinator
===============================

dzcoord is the dzen2 coordinator. It controls dzen bars and content for all screens.


Control
-------

dzcoord reads commands on stdin, and outputs data in dzen2 instances. 

The following commands are available:

screen id x y w h
  Information on screen dimension, all arguments are expected to be integers.

add_area area_name screen_id BOTTOM|TOP weight LEFT|CENTER|RIGHT
  Adds an area to the display in the specified bar (screen_id, TOP/BOTTOM).
  It floats to the LEFT or RIGHT as far as the weight allows it to. I can't
  remember what happens in case more than one window is specified as CENTER,
  so lets say it is undefined behavior.

rm_area area_name
  Remove the area with the specified name.

text area_name output
  Change the output in the specified area. The output format accepts most
  dzen arguments as usual. The one exception of the dzen commands is the ^i()
  command. In addition to the image path, a second argument containing the
  width of the image is needed.
  The format is also extended with some helpers for setting font color:
    ^focus()
    ^norm()
    ^low()
  which sets colors configured in the options.h file.
  There are also some special characters:
    # - insert padding (configurable as SPACE in options.h)
    | - insert a separator (configurable as SEPARATOR in options.h)
  Special characters can be escaped by doubling them: ##, ||, ^^.

Options
-------

Options are configured in the options.h header file.

Currently, only monospace fonts are supported by the program. The character
width must be specified in the options.h file for the program to work.
